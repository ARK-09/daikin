            What is the Daikin Building Controller?
          </h3>
          <p class="text-secondary">
            The Daikin Building Controller, powered by NIAGARA, connects all
            field devices within a building, including HVAC systems, AHUs, and
            lighting. This smooth integration enables comprehensive control and
            monitoring of your infrastructure.
            <br />
            <br />
            With its tailored HVAC solutions, the controller optimizes energy
            efficiency and system performance, providing a smarter, more
            efficient way to manage building operations.
